        The Green municipalities project tries to show the importance of
        performance in websites by showing how a website's size in kilobytes and
        megabytes affect its carbon footprint.

        We can optimize images by scaling them down to just as big as we need

          >carbon dioxide equivalents</a
        >
        are emitted by opening each of the Norwegian municipalities' websites,
        and we offer tips and tricks for decreasing the emissions each visitor
        produces.
