      <h1>Green municipalities</h1>

      <p>
        The Green municipalities project aims to show the importance of
        performance in websites by showing how a website's size in kilobytes and
        megabytes affect its carbon footprint.
      </p>

      <p>
        The numbers on this page are calculated by
        <a href="https://websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a>'s
        <a href="https://api.websitecarbon.com/">API</a>. As can be seen below,
        each page view does not emit very many grams of CO₂, however these
        websites only get a tiny portion of the page views of the world, so it
        definitely adds up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Norwegian municipalities have been chosen because we think public
        services should be role models, and because there are more than 300 of
        them which are highly similar in contents. Do you see your website on
        the list and you want to improve? For now, please reach out to us by
        creating an
        <a href="https://github.com/boyum/green-municipalities/issues/new"
          >issue on GitHub</a
        >, either in English or Norwegian.

        We can optimize images by scaling them down to just as big as we need
        them, and there are many techniques to make a website's code base
        smaller. The Green municipalities project shows how many
        <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=285"
          >carbon dioxide equivalents</a
        >
        are emitted by opening each of the Norwegian municipalities' websites,
        and we want to offer tips and tricks for decreasing the emissions each
        visitor produces.

        This project is still in development and can be followed on
