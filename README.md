# [Green municipalities](https://green.sinre.no)

A website that weekly collects statistics from Norway's 357 municipalities and calculates how much CO₂ is emitted per page view.
The website uses [Website Carbon](https://websitecarbon.com/) to generate the stats.

## What?

The Green municipalities project aims to show how a website's size in kilobytes and megabytes affects its carbon footprint.
We want to show how many carbon dioxide equivalents are emitted by opening each of the Norwegian municipalities' websites, and we want to offer tips and tricks for decreasing the emissions each visitor produces.

## How?

The numbers on this page are calculated by Website Carbon's API.
One can read more about how they calculate emissions on their website, but in short, they find the size of the frontpage in kilobytes and megabytes, and calculate how much power is spent when that amount of bytes is downloaded to the visitor's computer.
Each page view does not emit very many grams of CO₂, however these websites only get a tiny portion of the page views of the world, so it definitely adds up.

> The average web page tested produces 1.76 grams CO₂ per page view.
> For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 211 kg CO₂ per year.

## Why?

Norwegian municipalities have been chosen because we think public services should be role models, and because there are 357 of them which are highly similar in contents.

## What helps?

We can optimize images by scaling them down to just as big as we need them, and there are many techniques to make a website's code base smaller.
For instance, we can use modern (or very traditional) methods of creating websites.

Do you see your website on the list and you want to improve?
For now, please reach out to us by creating an issue on GitHub, either in English or Norwegian.

## How can I take part?

This project is still in development and can be followed on GitHub. Contributions are welcome.
