      <h1>How green is your municipality's website?</h1>

      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        The Green municipalities project aims to show how a website's size in
        kilobytes and megabytes affects its carbon footprint. We want to show
        how many
        <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=285"
          >carbon dioxide equivalents</a
        >
        are emitted by opening each of the Norwegian municipalities' websites,
        and we want to offer tips and tricks for decreasing the emissions each
        visitor produces.
      </p>

      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        The numbers on this page are calculated by
        <a href="https://websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a>'s
        <a href="https://api.websitecarbon.com/">API</a>. One can read more
        about how they calculate emissions on their website, but in short, they
        find the size of the frontpage in kilobytes and megabytes, and calculate
        how much power is spent when that amount of bytes is downloaded to the
        visitor's computer. As can be seen below, each page view does not emit
        very many grams of CO₂, however these websites only get a tiny portion
        of the page views of the world, so it definitely adds up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The average web page tested produces 1.76 grams CO₂ per page view. For a
        website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's 211 kg CO₂ per year.

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Norwegian municipalities have been chosen because we think public
        services should be role models, and because there are more than 300 of
        them which are highly similar in contents.
      </p>

      <h2>What helps?</h2>
      <p>
        We can optimize images by scaling them down to just as big as we need
        them, and there are many techniques to make a website's code base
        smaller.
